##Installing openCV

Unzip the download into a directory of your choice. Then go into the ```release```  folder to do the compiling. 

We want to install openCV in our user space (not the system space), so we don't need su rights to do so. This can be achieved using

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/sjh/software/opencv-2.4.13/lib ..

then you can do 

    ./configure
    make 
    make install
   
NB actually, if you do this from the folder /home/sjh/software/opencv-2.4.13/release, you can use this without doing the make install. 

##Testing a complie outside eclipse

Following http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_gcc_cmake/linux_gcc_cmake.html

We need to tell cmake where to look for the opencv libraries, because they aren't in the usual place. This can be done by setting an environment variable like this: 

    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/sjh/software/opencv-2.4.13/release/
    
NB: you'll need to add this to your .profile if you want this environment variable to be permanent.     

then it's just 

    cmake .
    make
  
works fine
